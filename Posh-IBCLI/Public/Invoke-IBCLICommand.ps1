    .SYNOPSIS
        Run an Infoblox remote console CLI command and return the output.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The given command is sent to the remote CLI and the resulting output is captured and returned as a string array.

    .PARAMETER Command
        The CLI command to run on the Infoblox appliance.

    .PARAMETER ShellStream
        A Renci.SshNet.ShellStream object that was returned from Connect-IBCLI.

    .PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
        The number of seconds (Default: 10) to wait for the command output to finish if a known prompt isn't recognized. If the timeout is reached, the cmdlet will return whatever output it has read up until that point.

    .PARAMETER AlternatePrompt
        An alternate prompt to wait for when processing the command output. If the read output contains this value at the end of the string, it will consider the command complete and return the output. This is useful when you know in advance that a command will produce a non-standard prompt.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.String[]. Invoke-IBCLICommand returns a string array that contains each non-empty line of output from the command sent. The returned lines have leading and trailing whitespace trimmed.

    .EXAMPLE
        Invoke-IBCLICommand -Command 'show status' -ShellStream $stream

        Run the 'show status' command against the appliance referenced by $stream.

    .EXAMPLE
        Invoke-IBCLICommand 'reboot' $stream
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM? (y or n):
        PS C:\>Invoke-IBCLICommand 'y' $stream
        SYSTEM REBOOTING!

        Run the 'reboot' command followed by 'y' to confirm the reboot operation.
